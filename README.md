# FC Barcelona Reminder Bot üîµüî¥

A Telegram bot that sends timely reminders for FC Barcelona's upcoming matches. Never miss a Bar√ßa game again! The bot sends notifications 7, 5, and 2 hours before each FC Barcelona league and Champions League match.

## Project Motivation

As a passionate FC Barcelona fan, I often found myself missing games or rushing to catch them at the last minute due to my busy schedule and the challenge of keeping track of varying match times. This personal pain point inspired me to create a solution that would help not just me, but other Bar√ßa fans never miss a match again. The bot automatically sends reminders at strategic intervals before each game, ensuring that fans have enough time to prepare and tune in to support our beloved club. Whether it's a crucial Champions League fixture or a regular league match, this bot helps keep the Cul√©s community connected to every game.
